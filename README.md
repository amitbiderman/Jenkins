Jenkins Project Repository

This repository contains the source code for my Jenkins project.
This project can be activated solely from Jenkins, it copies the related file automatically to the designated folder.
It can run three files together (allows you to also pick only one or two )- each written in a different language, to show the ability of running three tests together.
Code is written in Groovy.

Output is shown in Jenkins.
